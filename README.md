# Task-1-Data-Preprocessing
AI &amp; ML Internship - Task 1: Data Cleaning &amp; Preprocessing using Titanic Dataset
## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning model development.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🔎 Steps Performed

1. Imported required libraries.
2. Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
3. Explored dataset structure using `df.info()`.
4. Identified missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`.
5. Handled missing values using mean and mode.
6. Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
7. Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler.
8. Visualized outliers using boxplots.

## 📊 Data Preprocessing Techniques Used
- Missing Value Imputation
- Categorical Encoding
- Feature Scaling
- Outlier Detection

## ✅ Conclusion
The dataset was successfully cleaned and preprocessed. 
All missing values were handled, categorical variables were encoded, 
and numerical features were scaled. The dataset is now ready 
for machine learning model building.
